Thanks for helping <%= @event.owner %> with “<%= @event.name %>”.

You voted for:

<% @event.user_votes(@user).each do |vote| %>
  "<%= vote.suggestion.primary %><%= "," if vote.suggestion.secondary.present? %> <%= vote.suggestion.secondary %>"
<% end %>

To change your vote or find out how other people have voted, visit <%= event_url(@event) %>.

<% if @user != @event.owner %>
  <%= render 'footer' %>
<% end %>
