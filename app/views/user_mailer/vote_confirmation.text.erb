Thanks for helping <%= @event.user.name %> with “<%= @event.name %>”.

You voted for:

<% @event.user_votes(@user).each do |vote| %>
  "<%= vote.suggestion.primary %><%= "," if vote.suggestion.secondary.present? %> <%= vote.suggestion.secondary %>"
<% end %>

To change your vote or find out how other people have voted, <%= link_to "click here", event_url(@event, guest_email: @user.email) %>.

*Did you know you can send your own polls for free? Use sched.do to plan events easily and collect feedback fast on virtually any topic. Learn more at <%= link_to "#{root_url}", root_url %>.
